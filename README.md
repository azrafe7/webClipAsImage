# Overview
Click on the extension icon, select an element on the page and click on it.

Voil√†... A screenshot of that element will open in a new tab.
Hold SHIFT to clip multiple elements on the page, or press ESC to quit clipping mode.

You can also take a screenshot of the visible page:
right-click on the extension button and select 'Take page screenshot...'.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Under-the-hood it takes a screenshot of the current (visible) page, and then crops it using position and size of the highlighted element.
Should also work when the browser page is zoomed in/out.

And all happens inside your browser, nothing is sent online (check the code at https://github.com/azrafe7/webClipElement). ;D
